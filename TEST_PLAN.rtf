\cf0 TODO APP TEST PLAN\
\
1.) Default state of page, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://todomvc.com/examples/angular2/"}}{\fldrslt http://todomvc.com/examples/angular2/}}\
     A.) Visit the todo app using the link above and ensure the following items appear as expected:\
           -A \'91todos\'92 title is displayed\
           -An input field is displayed and accessible by clicking and typing characters\
             *The field should contain subdued text which reads, \'91What needs to be done?\'92\
           -Text should be displayed, \'91Double-click to edit a todo\'92\
           -4 links should be accessible\
             *2 of them lead to specific authors\'92 GitHub spaces\
             *One should lead to the \'91angular.io\'92 website\
             *The final link should lead to the \'91todomvc.com\'92 website\
\
2.) Able to add todo items\
     A.) Type in specific text into the input field provided and press \'91enter/return\'92\
           -\ul Expected\ulnone : The typed entry is added on the page and new items appear beside the entry\
            * A label appears at the bottom left displaying, \'91# items left\'92\
            * A carat \'91^\'92 appears at the top left beside the input field for selecting all todos created\
            * A clickable \'91circle\'92 appears to the left of the newly-created entry to mark the todo as\
              completed\
              -\ul Expected\ulnone : After clicking the circle, the todo is marked as completed; additionally, a \'91Clear completed\'92 link appears\
               at the bottom right of the page to remove the entries from view that are completed\
            * Hovering over to the right side of the item results in a visible \'91x\'92 button which is clicked to\
               delete the todo from the list\
\
     B.) Add more items, delete, complete, clear completed\
          -Add as many items on the page; ensure that the \'91# items left\'92 increases with each new todo added; the page should expand down\
          -Delete items on the page; the \'91# items left\'92 should decrease by 1 each time, and the page should collapse up\
          -Click on the \'91circle\'92 to the left of some todos\
           -\ul Expected\ulnone : The todo entry beside the circle receives a strikethrough on its text and is marked as completed\
            *The \'91# items left\'92 should decrease by 1\
            *A checkmark appears in the circle upon click\
          -Click on the carat \'91^\'92 on the top left of the page\
            -\ul Expected\ulnone : All items in the list receive strikethrough and are marked as completed; the \'91# items left\'92  is set to \'910\'92 and the\
             \'91Clear completed\'92 link is visible.\
          -Click on the \'91Clear completed\'92 link\
           -\ul Expected\ulnone : The items marked as completed will be removed from view and only the todos not marked as completed will remain\
\
3.) Edit todo items\
     A.) Double-click on any todo text to edit the specific item\
           -\ul Expected\ulnone : The text field should have a dark border applied and a cursor should allow the text to be modified within it\
          -Type any different character combination and press enter/return to save the updated text to the entry\
     B.) Clear text and try to save a pre-existing todo\
           -\ul BUG\ulnone : Text can be cleared; however, the previous todo text is not preserved when enter/return is pressed; the item is automatically deleted from view\
                       This same condition applies to items marked as completed which can also be edited\
\
4.) Test links on page\
      -Access the 4 links on the page to ensure they route to the correct sites\
\
5.) Browser cache\
     -Ensure that the todo list preserves the items added without clearing cache in the browser. Navigate away to another couple of sites and return\
      to the page\
       -\ul Expected\ulnone : The items should still be listed that were added and/or marked as completed\
     -Clear the browser cache and reload the page\
       -\ul Expected\ulnone : The page will load with none of the entries preserved in the last step performed\
\
6.) Input validation\
     -Ensure that the input field for new todos can accept any characters (UTF-8)\
     -Ensure that there is a set limit to how many characters can be entered into the input field\
      \ul BUG\ulnone : The input field allows for next to infinite amount of characters to be entered; this should be limited due to constraints on readability in addition to performance\
